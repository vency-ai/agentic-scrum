# Digital Scrum Master (DSM)

**An open-source Digital Scrum Master: an AI agent that runs your sprints end-to-end on Kubernetes.**

DSM is a production-grade microservices ecosystem where an intelligent AI agent orchestrates complete Agile workflows—from project kickoff through sprint execution to retrospectives—using REST APIs, Redis Streams, and a learning agent "brain."

Built for engineers exploring **agentic orchestration**, **event-driven microservices**, **Kubernetes-native applications**, and **AI in the SDLC**.

## The Problem DSM Solves

Most "AI project management" demos stop at generating tickets or chat interfaces. They don't actually *run* a sprint, make autonomous decisions, or learn from outcomes.

**DSM goes further:** It simulates a complete digital Scrum team with an AI that plans sprints, tracks daily progress, learns from retrospectives, and continuously improves its strategies. Because it's **API-driven by design**, DSM can easily integrate with real project management tools like **JIRA, Asana, Trello, and Monday.com**—calling their APIs to orchestrate projects and provide intelligent insights on live data.

**🤖 True Agentic Intelligence**  
Not just LLM wrappers—DSM's orchestrator uses episodic memory (pgvector), a strategy knowledge base, and continuous learning loops to make informed decisions and improve over time.

**🔄 Event-Driven Architecture at Scale**  
Hybrid REST + Redis Streams design demonstrates real-world event-driven patterns: asynchronous task updates, sprint events, and eventual consistency across services.

**☸️ Kubernetes-Native Infrastructure**  
Running on K8s isn't just deployment—it's the foundation for resilience, horizontal scaling, resource management, and production-grade patterns like Pod Disruption Budgets and health checks.

**🏗️ Production-Ready Patterns**  
Database-per-service, circuit breakers, structured logging, observability guidance, and comprehensive documentation make this a reference architecture, not a toy demo.

**🔌 Integration-Ready Design**  
RESTful APIs for every service mean DSM can connect to external systems—fetch real project data from JIRA, sync backlogs with Asana, or export insights to Monday.com.

## Key Features

**Digital Scrum Team as Microservices**
- **Project Service** (HR Manager): Master data for teams, roles, PTO, holidays
- **Backlog Service** (Product Owner): Manages product backlog and task prioritization
- **Sprint Service** (Team Lead): Runs sprint lifecycle and daily scrum simulations

## Architecture at a Glance

DSM is built as a set of microservices running on Kubernetes, with an AI “Scrum Master” orchestrator, a digital Scrum team of services, and an agent brain backed by PostgreSQL + pgvector and Redis Streams.

## Quick Start (30-Minute Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Local Kubernetes cluster (`kind`, `minikube`, or `Docker Desktop`)
- `kubectl` configured
- 8GB+ RAM available for the cluster

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vency-ai/agentic-scrum.git
cd agentic-scrum
```

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure
Create the namespace and deploy databases, Redis, and Ollama:
```bash
kubectl apply -f setups/00-namespace.yml
kubectl apply -f db/
kubectl apply -f agent-ai/ollama/
```

Wait for databases and Ollama to be ready:
```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=project-db -n dsm --timeout=300s
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=ollama -n dsm --timeout=300s
```

### Step 3: Deploy Services
Deploy all microservices:
```bash
kubectl apply -f services/project-service/k8s/
kubectl apply -f services/backlog-service/k8s/
kubectl apply -f services/sprint-service/k8s/
kubectl apply -f services/chronicle-service/k8s/
kubectl apply -f services/project-orchestrator/k8s/
kubectl apply -f agent-ai/embedding-service/k8s/
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
Check that all services are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n dsm
```

Deploy a debug pod to test connectivity:
```bash
kubectl apply -f Debug-tools/debug-curl-pod.yml
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -n dsm -- curl -s http://project-orchestrator.dsm.svc.cluster.local/health/ready | jq
```

### Step 5: Run Your First Project
Trigger the orchestrator to create and run a complete project:
```bash
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -n dsm -- curl -X POST \
  http://project-orchestrator.dsm.svc.cluster.local/orchestrate/project/1 | jq
```

**What happens next:**
1. AI agent analyzes project requirements
2. Creates backlog with prioritized tasks
3. Plans and starts sprint
4. Daily scrums run automatically via CronJob
5. Sprint closes with retrospective analysis
6. Agent learns from outcomes and updates strategies

For detailed deployment steps and troubleshooting, see the [**Full Setup Guide**](docs/DSM_Setup_guide.md).

## Real-World Integration Examples

**Connect to JIRA:**
```python
# Fetch live JIRA issues and let DSM plan the sprint
jira_tasks = jira_api.get_project_issues(project_key="PROJ")
dsm_response = requests.post(
    "http://orchestrator/orchestrate/project/1",
    json={"external_tasks": jira_tasks}
)
```

**Sync with Asana:**
```python
# Push DSM sprint insights back to Asana
sprint_summary = requests.get("http://chronicle/notes/sprint_retrospective/1").json()
asana_api.create_task(
    project_id="12345",
    name="Sprint 1 Retrospective",
    notes=sprint_summary["insights"]
)
```

DSM's API-first design means you can plug it into any workflow.

##  Kubernetes Role in DSM

Kubernetes isn't just a deployment platform—it's integral to DSM's architecture:

- **High Availability:** Multi-replica services with Pod Disruption Budgets ensure critical components (Sprint Service) stay operational during updates
- **Resource Isolation:** Explicit CPU/memory limits prevent resource contention between AI workloads (Ollama) and core services
- **Self-Healing:** Liveness and readiness probes automatically restart unhealthy pods and stop routing traffic to degraded services
- **Scalability:** Stateless services can horizontally scale based on load; StatefulSets provide stable identities for databases
- **Service Discovery:** Built-in DNS enables seamless service-to-service communication without hardcoded IPs
- **Declarative Infrastructure:** GitOps-ready manifests make the entire system reproducible and versionable 
>This makes DSM a realistic example of cloud-native AI orchestration, not just a Docker Compose experiment.
